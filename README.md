## Database Schema

The database manages the following entities:

- **Employee** - Players, coaches, and referees
- **Team** - Premier League clubs
- **City** - Geographic locations of teams
- **Stadium** - Venue information
- **Award** - Player achievements and honors
- **MainSponsorship** - Team sponsorship deals
- **Matches** - Match records with scores and attendance
- **HeadReferee** - Match officials

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Java JDK 8 or higher
- JDBC driver for your database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server)
- Database server (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, or SQLite)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/premier-league-db.git
   cd premier-league-db
   ```

2. **Set up the database**
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE premier_league;
   USE premier_league;
   SOURCE sql/Award.sql;
   SOURCE sql/AwayTeam.sql;
   SOURCE sql/Matches.sql;
   -- Import remaining SQL files
   ```

3. **Create configuration file**
   ```bash
   cp auth.cfg.example auth.cfg
   ```
   
   Edit `auth.cfg`:
   ```properties
   username=your_database_username
   password=your_database_password
   ```

4. **Update database connection**
   
   Edit `src/BackEnd.java` and update the connection URL:
   ```java
   String connectionUrl = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/premier_league"
       + "?user=" + username
       + "&password=" + password;
   ```

5. **Compile and run**
   ```bash
   make build
   make run
   ```

## Usage

Once started, you'll see the interactive prompt:

```
db >
```

### Basic Commands

```bash
db > h              # Show help menu
db > team           # Display all teams
db > employee       # Display all employees
db > q              # Exit program
```

### Search Queries

```bash
db > ec Ronaldo     # Search employees by name
db > eid 101        # Find employee by ID
db > mrid 5         # Show matches by referee ID
```

### Analytical Queries

```bash
db > gpo            # Group employees by position with statistics
db > aat            # Average attendance per match day
db > apl            # Average player age per team
db > taw            # Team awards count
db > mbsc           # Derby matches (same-city teams)
db > phs            # Players in high-sponsorship teams (>100M)
db > tah            # Total home match attendance by team
db > ref5           # Referees with most 50K+ attendance matches
db > tops           # Top scorers in negative goal difference teams
db > cct            # Cities with stadium capacity and team counts
db > cll            # Cities with largest stadiums and lowest points
```
